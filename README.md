## Description
In this week's challenge, as a transitional web developer I was tasked with creating a powerful Node.js command-line tool. Svg Logo Maker is an application designed to empower web developers by enabling them to effortlessly generate simple logos for their projects. Svg Logo Maker allows a seamless blend of user-friendly prompts and a range of customization options, including text, colors, and shapes. This tool provides a cost-effective solution for creating personalized logos, eliminating the need for external graphic designers.

## User Story
```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

```

1. JavaScript
2. Node.js
3. Inquirer Package
4. Jest Package
5. Visual Studio Code(VS-code)
6. Github: Github was used to create a repository which includes the links to the projects, index.js, package.json, and the README file.
7. Gitlab: Gitlab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation
1. To install the challenge#10 , first create a new repository in your Github account, and then clone this repository to your local computer. 
```
To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git   
```           
2. Install Node.js [v20.11.0]
3. Install Jest [v29.7.0]
4. Open the cloned repository in a visual studio code. 
5. Open integrated terminal on index.js in order to run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" on the command line to install inquirer package, jest packing using the command "npm install jest --save-dev. In addition, create a gitignore file, which should include node_modules.

## Usage
1. Open the cloned repostory in a source code editor(visual studio code). 
2. Open integrated terminal on index.js. 
3. Enter "node index.js n command line. 
4. Presented with npm inquirer questions through sequential order within directory - Users are required to input essential information in order to generate a shape.
